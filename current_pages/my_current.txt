Important update: Healthcare facilities

CDC has updated select ways to operate healthcare systems effectively in
response to COVID-19 vaccination. [ Learn more

[COVID-19 Homepage](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/)

To maximize protection from the [Delta
variant](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-
variant.html) and prevent possibly spreading it to others, get vaccinated as
soon as you can and wear a mask indoors in public if you are in [an area of
substantial or high transmission.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker
/#county-view)

UPDATE

Given new evidence on the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, CDC has updated the
[guidance for fully vaccinated
people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-
vaccinated.html). CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers,
staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination
status. Children should return to full-time in-person learning in the fall
with layered prevention strategies in place.

**After experiencing a brief decline in COVID-19 [cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases), the United States is once again seeing an increase in cases in most of the country. This recent increase follows a previous summer surge that was fueled by the highly contagious [Delta](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html) (B.1.617.2) variant and [low vaccination coverage](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-county-view) in many communities. [COVID-19 vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) offer strong protection against serious illness and death. High vaccination coverage is proven to reduce the spread of the virus. The less a virus spreads, the less opportunity there is for new variants to emerge.**

The virus that causes COVID-19 constantly changes, or mutates, producing new
[variants](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant.html) of the virus. The
Delta variant continues to be the predominant strain in the United States,
making up [more than 99%](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-
proportions) of cases. On August 30, 2021, the [World Health
Organizationexternal icon](https://www.who.int/) classified the Mu (B.1.621)
variant as a [Variant of Interest](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-
info.html#Interest) (VOI). CDC has not designated Mu as a VOI at this time.
The Mu variant reached a peak in the United States in late June 2021 and has
steadily declined since then.* CDC continues to study and monitor all known
variants and will continue to provide information when variants change
[classification](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html) in the
United States.

[Getting vaccinated](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html) is the best
way to protect yourself, your family, and your community. It is also the best
way to prevent new variants from emerging. A recent [CDC
study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm?s_cid=mm7037e1_w)
found that people who were not fully vaccinated had about 10 times the risk of
being hospitalized with or dying from COVID-19 compared with people who were
[fully vaccinated](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html). CDC
recommends that everyone in the United States 12 years and older get
vaccinated as soon as possible. To find a vaccine provider near you, visit
[Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) or your [state or local public
health department website](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirec
tories/healthdepartments.html).

*At its peak, Mu made up less than 5% of all variants circulating in the United States. Currently, Mu makes up less than 1% of all COVID-19 cases in the United States. 

_**Note to readers:**_ CDC scientists continue to study and monitor the Mu
variant and will continue to provide information when variants change
[classification](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html) in the
United States. Sign up [here](https://tools.cdc.gov/campaignproxyservice/subsc

Classification and Definitions webpage.

## Reported Cases

The current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (146,182) increased 6.1%
compared with the previous 7-day moving average (137,783). A total of
41,593,179 COVID-19 cases have been reported as of September 15, 2021.

## SARS-CoV-2 Variants

Multiple [variants](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant.html) of the virus
that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally, including within the United
States. Currently, four variants are classified as a [variant of
concern](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html) (VOC). [Nowcast
estimates](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions)*of
COVID-19 cases caused by these VOCs for the week ending September 11, 2021,
are summarized here. Nationally, the combined proportion of cases attributed
to Delta is estimated to be greater than 99%. The national proportions of
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are estimated to be less than 0.1%. Nowcast estimates
indicate that Delta will continue to be the predominant variant circulating in
all 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions, circulating
at greater than 99%. The proportions of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are estimated
to be less than or equal to 0.1% in all HHS regions.

*The median time from specimen collection to sequence data reporting is about 3 weeks. As a result, weighted estimates for the most recent few weeks may be unstable or unavailable. CDC's Nowcast is a data projection tool that helps fill this gap by generating timely estimates of variant proportions for variants that are circulating in the United States. View Nowcast estimates on CDC's COVID Data Tracker website on the [Variant Proportions](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) page.

## Vaccinations

The U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14, 2020. As of September
16, 2021, 383 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about
210.7 million people, or 63.5% of the total U.S. population, have received at
least one dose of vaccine. About 180.1 million people, or 54.2% of the total
U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated.* As of September 16, 2021, the
7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported (by date of CDC
report) to CDC per day was 773,763, a 1.6% decrease from the previous week.

CDC's COVID Data Tracker [Vaccination Demographic
Trends](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-
trends) tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of September 16, 2021,
93% of people ages 65 years or older have received at least one dose of
vaccine and 82.7% are fully vaccinated. Over three-quarters (76.1%) of people
ages 18 years or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 65.4%
are fully vaccinated. For people ages 12 years or older, 74.2% have received
at least one dose of vaccine and 63.5% are fully vaccinated.

New admissions are pulled from a 10 am EST snapshot of the HHS Unified
Hospital Timeseries Dataset. Due to potential reporting delays, data from the
most recent 7 days, as noted in the figure above with the grey bar, should be
interpreted with caution. Small shifts in historic data may also occur due to
changes in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Provider of

### COVID-NET: Trends in Hospitalization Rates in Children Ages 11 Years and
Younger Not Eligible for Vaccination

CDC's [Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance
Network (COVID-NET)](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-
methods.html) shows that hospitalization rates are increasing, including rates
in children ages 11 years and younger. Recent weekly rates of
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations for these children are the highest they
have ever been. Weekly rates in children ages 4 years and younger for the week
ending August 28, 2021, are 2.4 per 100,000. Rates in children ages 5-11 years
are 0.9 per 100,000 for weeks ending August 9 and August 21, 2021. Unlike
adults, children younger than 12 years of age are not yet eligible for any of
the available COVID-19 vaccines.
